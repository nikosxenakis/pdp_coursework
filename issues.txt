The squirrel parapoxvirus virus can live without a host in the environment for 2
months.



o Each time the month changes the cells should be updated to represent the past 3
months
• Land cells each have an infectionLevel which is calculated as the total number of infected
squirrels that have been in the specific cell in the past 2 months.
o All squirrels are born healthy so won’t contribute to this level
o If a squirrel steps and ends up in the same cell, this counts as a squirrel arriving
in the cell. (In other words, every hop can be treated in the same way, as a
squirrel arriving in a cell.)
o Each time the month changes the cells should be updated to represent the past 2
months
• After every 50 steps, a squirrel will reproduce with a probability depending only on the
average populationInflux of all of the cells they have visited in their last 50 steps.
• After every step, the squirrel will catch the disease with a probability depending on the
infectionLevel of all the cells they have visited in the last 50 steps.
• An infected squirrel will live for a minimum of 50 steps, after this then they will die with
a fixed probability of 1/6 for each step after.
